# Welcome to kcftools documentation! 

**KCFTOOLS** is a Java-based toolset for identifying genomic variations through counting kmer presence/absence between reference and query genomes. It utilizes precomputed k-mer count databases (from [KMC](https://github.com/refresh-bio/KMC)) to perform a wide array of genomic analyses including variant detection, IBS window identification, and genotype matrix generation.
